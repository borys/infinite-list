Infinite list implementation.

Scope:
- load data when reached end of list
- data is static - no new items are added ([more complex scenario](https://phauer.com/2017/web-api-pagination-continuation-token/))
- concentrate on data loading (scroll optimization is out of scope)
- open item details on click 
- implement 'go back' from item details to list view, (item should be visible on the list)

Solutions:
- using onScroll event: monitor if reached scroll bottom
- using IntersectionObserver: place element at the end of list and observe it, load data when visible

Mocking Data:
- @stoplight/prism-cli
  - pros:
    - forces creating contract using OpenAPI
    - reuse contract to mock data
    - helps to validate contract before backend implementation
  - cons:
    - no control how much data is returned when return array (without hardcoding in mockup)
    - may return duplicated values f.e. items with same id for different query params
    - can't implement paging correctly
    - needs to run server
- json-server for serving data generated by f.e. https://www.mockaroo.com
  - pros:
    - simple and fast solution
    - support basic paging
  - cons:
    - can't use own paging options
    - still cannot implement more complicated scenario
    - needs run server
